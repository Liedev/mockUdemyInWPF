## What Is Mock Udemy

A C# database(SQL) first approach project where you could subscribe to a learning course.

## Project

The goal of the project was to deliver a wpf project where a user(student, admin, or teacher) could subscribe, adjust, delete a course.
Together with my fellow students <a href="http://www.stijnbeckers.digital/" target="_blank">Stijn</a> and <a href="https://jarnopeeters.be/" target="_blank">Jarno</a> we created a simpel rendition of the site e-learning platform Udemy.
